# ExternalMSI

This is a project showcasing how a company could build out MSI for their sales reps allowing them to see the top prospects they should be going after. Using Marketoâ€™s SOAP & REST API we are able to rebuild Marketo Sales Insight and provide the information our sales reps need to be successful. 

Requirements: 
- Knowledge of Pyython and Flask
- A Marketo instance with an API account (all API credentials)
- Creating a list for each sales rep so they can each have their individual Best Bets dashboard
